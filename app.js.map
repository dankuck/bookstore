The return value will be a new object, called\n | an observer, which will reflect all the values of the original object\n | transparently. The observer will appear just like the original object,\n | except that an === check will fail.\n |\n | Any time you change the observer, the changes will be reflected on the\n | original object and `callback` will be called.\n |\n | The callback will be called with a single parameter, an object with\n | `{path, type, value, params}`.\n |\n | - path   An ordered array of strings, which can be clunkily joined to\n |          describe the data path to the property being mutated\n | - type   A string, one of\n |          'assign' if the mutation was an assignment,\n |          'apply' if the mutation was a method call,\n |          'delete' if the mutation was a deletion, or\n |          'construct' if the mutation was a construction on a class or\n |          function being observed\n | - value  The value that was assigned. Only present if the mutation was an\n |          'assign'\n | - params An ordered array of the parameters given to a method call. Only\n |          present if the mutation was an 'apply' or 'construct'\n |\n | Example:\n |   import { observe } from 'MutationWatcher.js';\n |   const myObject = {answer: 42};\n |   const observer = observe(myObject, console.log);\n |\n |   observer.question = 'What is 6 x 7?';\n |   // {path: ['root', 'question'], type: 'assign', value: 'What is 6 x 7?'}\n |   console.log(myObject.question)\n |   // 'What is 6 x 7?'\n |\n | The path given to the callback will refer to your original object as 'root'\n | unless you provide a third parameter to `observe()`, an array which will\n | be used to start all the paths given to the callback.\n |\n | Example:\n |   const observer = observe(window.alert, console.log, ['window', 'alert']);\n |   observer('hi');\n |   // Alert: hi\n |   // {path: ['window', 'alert', '(...)'], type: 'apply', params: ['hi']}\n |\n | Changes to the original object will be reflected on the observer, but the\n | callback will not be called.\n |\n |--------------------\n | Best Practice\n |--------------------\n |\n | 1. Best Practice: It is best practice to use only the observer, and ignore\n |    the original object.\n |\n | Just as the observer is a different object from the original object, a\n | property on the observer will be different from the same property\n | on the original object.\n |\n | Example:\n |   const myObject = {cake: {}, age: 100}\n |   const observer = observe(myObject, console.log);\n |   observer === myObject;\n |   // false\n |   observer.cake === myObject.cake\n |   // false\n |   observer.age === myObject.age\n |   // true, primitives are passed through untouched\n |\n | 2. Best Practice: Expect new values added to an observer to be converted to\n |    observers too. Do not depend on === if you add a new value to an\n |    observer.\n |\n | Assignments on an observer involve an implicit observe() call, so the value\n | being assigned will come back as an observer. I.e., if the value was an\n | object it will now be a different object. Unless it was already an observer.\n |\n | Example:\n |   const observer = observe([])\n |   const toy = {};\n |   observer[0] = toy;\n |   observer[0] === toy;\n |   // false, but don't panic\n |   observer[1] = toy;\n |   observer[0] === observer[1];\n |   // true\n |\n | 3. Best Practice: Expect `this` to be the observer within methods.\n |\n | Methods called on the observer will be called with the observer as the\n | `this` context.\n |\n | Example:\n |   const original = {\n |     whoAmI() {\n |       if (this === original) {\n |        return 'I am the original';\n |       } else if (this === observer) {\n |        return 'I am the observer';\n |       }\n |     }\n |   };\n |   const observer = observe(original);\n |   observer.whoAmI();\n |   // I am the observer\n |   original.whoAmI();\n |   // I am the original\n |\n |--------------------\n | Future\n |--------------------\n |\n | Observers send updates to the callback every time a method is called. But\n | many methods do not cause mutations. In a future version, we will only send\n | updates about method calls that result in a mutation: an assignment or one\n | of several Array methods.\n */\n\n// Does the string end with \"native code] }\" or something close?

Oh and it works recursively, of course.\n |\n | Example:\n | const reviver = new Reviver();\n | const data = {\n |     'title': 'Champagne Supernova',\n |     'created_at': new Date('1996-05-13'),\n | };\n | const json = reviver.stringify(data);\n | const copy = reviver.parse(json);\n | console.log(data, copy);\n | // Then you see the same thing twice.\n |\n | // JSON would have converted your Date object into a string\n | const badJson = JSON.stringify(data);\n | const badCopy = JSON.parse(badJson);\n | console.log(badCopy)\n | // Then you notice that it doesn't look like the ones above\n |\n | The Date, Map, and Set classes are built into Reviver. All other classes\n | must be added to a reviver instance using register().\n |\n | Best practice:\n |\n | When you create a reviver, immediately pass your custom data class(es) to\n | reviver.register(). Define a class-level method on your custom class called\n | registerReviver(reviver). Within registerReviver(), call the reviver.addClass()\n | method and pass any other classes you'll need to reviver.register().\n |\n | Example:\n | // app.js\n | const reviver = new Reviver();\n | reviver.register(Mouse);\n |\n | // Mouse.js\n | Mouse.registerReviver = function (reviver) {\n |     reviver.addClass(\n |         'Mouse',\n |         Mouse,\n |         plain => new Mouse(plain),\n |         mouse => ({...mouse})\n |     );\n |     reviver.register(Cheese);\n | };\n |\n | This keeps your code clean, and it allows the custom class to call\n | reviver.register() for any classes that it deems important.\n |\n | In the above example, if the Mouse holds a Cheese object, it can now trust\n | that the reviver will know how to serialize and revive it. The Mouse won't\n | have to do anything extra to ensure the cheese comes back intact. And if you\n | know anything about mice, you know they appreciate peace of mind, pieces of\n | cheese, and puns. 🧀 🐁\n |\n | Good to know:\n |\n | The two callbacks to add() are a reviver and a replacer. The reviver accepts\n | a plain object and should return an object of the given class. The replacer\n | accepts an object of the given class and should return a plain object.\n |\n | When the reviver runs, any objects contained inside the plain object have\n | already been through their revival process. IE, it's plain objects all the\n | way down.\n |\n | When the replacer runs, no objects contained inside the class instance have\n | been through their replacement processes. IE, it's original objects all the\n | way down.\n |\n | Caveats:\n |\n | If the same object is present in two places in an object tree, it will be\n | written as two objects in JSON and will be revived as two objects.\n |\n | For this reason, and because of how JSON works, it's important not to use\n | circular references. If you need circular references, you can work around\n | the restriction by nulling out the circular part in the data returned from\n | your replacer callback and fixing them again during your reviver callback.\n |\n | At this time, the JSON uses '__class__' and '__data__' as special key\n | strings, so you should not use those in your data. In the future, we expect\n | to add a protection mechanism so you can use those keys.\n |\n | Some built-in types cannot be revived. These are usally for good reasons: a\n | Promise or a Function hold code and getting that right in JSON is often\n | impossible. Symbols cannot retain the uniqueness feature they are intended\n | for, so they become null.\n |\n | Reviver's behavior with some of these data types is different from the\n | behavior you would expect if you're familiar with the JSON object.\n |\n | What follows is an exhaustive list of the ways the Reviver treats data. Any\n | built-in type not represented below has undefined behavior that may change\n | in the future.
