Oh and it works recursively, of course.\n |\n | Example:\n | const reviver = new Reviver();\n | const data = {\n |     'title': 'Champagne Supernova',\n |     'created_at': new Date('1996-05-13'),\n | };\n | const json = reviver.stringify(data);\n | const copy = reviver.parse(json);\n | console.log(data, copy);\n | // Then you see the same thing twice.\n |\n | // JSON would have converted your Date object into a string\n | const badJson = JSON.stringify(data);\n | const badCopy = JSON.parse(badJson);\n | console.log(badCopy)\n | // Then you notice that it doesn't look like the ones above\n |\n | The Date, Map, and Set classes are built into Reviver. All other classes\n | must be added to a reviver instance using register().\n |\n | Best practice:\n |\n | When you create a reviver, immediately pass your custom data class(es) to\n | reviver.register(). Define a class-level method on your custom class called\n | registerReviver(reviver). Within registerReviver(), call the reviver.addClass()\n | method and pass any other classes you'll need to reviver.register().\n |\n | Example:\n | // app.js\n | const reviver = new Reviver();\n | reviver.register(Mouse);\n |\n | // Mouse.js\n | Mouse.registerReviver = function (reviver) {\n |     reviver.addClass(\n |         'Mouse',\n |         Mouse,\n |         plain => new Mouse(plain),\n |         mouse => ({...mouse})\n |     );\n |     reviver.register(Cheese);\n | };\n |\n | This keeps your code clean, and it allows the custom class to call\n | reviver.register() for any classes that it deems important.\n |\n | In the above example, if the Mouse holds a Cheese object, it can now trust\n | that the reviver will know how to serialize and revive it. The Mouse won't\n | have to do anything extra to ensure the cheese comes back intact. And if you\n | know anything about mice, you know they appreciate peace of mind, pieces of\n | cheese, and puns. 🧀 🐁\n |\n | Good to know:\n |\n | The two callbacks to add() are a reviver and a replacer. The reviver accepts\n | a plain object and should return an object of the given class. The replacer\n | accepts an object of the given class and should return a plain object.\n |\n | When the reviver runs, any objects contained inside the plain object have\n | already been through their revival process. IE, it's plain objects all the\n | way down.\n |\n | When the replacer runs, no objects contained inside the class instance have\n | been through their replacement processes. IE, it's original objects all the\n | way down.\n |\n | Caveats:\n |\n | If the same object is present in two places in an object tree, it will be\n | written as two objects in JSON and will be revived as two objects.\n |\n | For this reason, and because of how JSON works, it's important not to use\n | circular references. If you need circular references, you can work around\n | the restriction by nulling out the circular part in the data returned from\n | your replacer callback and fixing them again during your reviver callback.\n |\n | At this time, the JSON uses '__class__' and '__data__' as special key\n | strings, so you should not use those in your data. In the future, we expect\n | to add a protection mechanism so you can use those keys.\n |\n | Some built-in types cannot be revived. These are usally for good reasons: a\n | Promise or a Function hold code and getting that right in JSON is often\n | impossible. Symbols cannot retain the uniqueness feature they are intended\n | for, so they become null.\n |\n | Reviver's behavior with some of these data types is different from the\n | behavior you would expect if you're familiar with the JSON object.\n |\n | What follows is an exhaustive list of the ways the Reviver treats data. Any\n | built-in type not represented below has undefined behavior that may change\n | in the future. All of these can be overwritten by a call to add().\n |\n | | In                           | Out                                     |\n | | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------            |\n | | primitives                   | Identical value                         |\n | | BitInt                       | Identical value                         |\n | | Date                         | Identical value                         |\n | | Map                          | Identical value                         |\n | | Set                          | Identical value                         |\n | | RegExp                       | Identical value                         |\n | | Error (or built-in subclass) | Identical value                         |\n | | Int8Array                    | Identical value                         |\n | | Uint8Array                   | Identical value                         |\n | | Uint8ClampedArray            | Identical value                         |\n | | Int16Array                   | Identical value                         |\n | | Uint16Array                  | Identical value                         |\n | | Int32Array                   | Identical value                         |\n | | Uint32Array                  | Identical value                         |\n | | Float32Array                 | Identical value                         |\n | | Float64Array                 | Identical value                         |\n | | BigInt64Array                | Identical value                         |\n | | BigUint64Array               | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.Collator                | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.DateTimeFormat          | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.ListFormat              | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.NumberFormat            | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.PluralRules             | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.RelativeTimeFormat      | Identical value                         |\n | | Intl.Locale                  | Identical value                         |\n | | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------            |\n | | Infinity                     | Infinity                                |\n | | NaN                          | NaN                                     |\n | | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------            |\n | | Number object                | Number primitive                        |\n | | String object                | String primitive                        |\n | | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------            |\n | | WeakMap                      | Empty WeakMap                           |\n | | WeakSet                      | Empty WeakSet                           |\n | | Promise                      | null                                    |\n | | null                         | null                                    |\n | | Symbol                       | null                                    |\n | | undefined                    | <absent>                                |\n | | Function (and subclasses)    | <absent>                                |\n | | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------            |\n | | Proxy object                 | An instance of the class that it wraps, |\n | |                              | having values given by the Proxy object |\n |\n | These built-in classes have undefined behavior and may be subject to\n | changing behavior in the future:\n | ArrayBuffer, SharedArrayBuffer, Atomics, DataView, WebAssembly, WebAssembly,\n | WebAssembly.Module, WebAssembly.Instance, WebAssembly.Memory,\n | WebAssembly.Tables\n |\n | Advanced:\n |\n | Non-class objects can be \"saved\" as well, by adding them via the\n | addObject() method.
