 | ------------------------
 | Reviver
 | ------------------------
 | Use a Reviver to serialize an object to a JSON string and revive it again
 | as an object of the same class. Oh and it works recursively, of course.
 |
 | Example:
 | const reviver = new Reviver();
 | const data = {
 |     'title': 'Champagne Supernova',
 |     'created_at': new Date('1996-05-13'),
 | };
 | const json = reviver.stringify(data);
 | const copy = reviver.parse(json);
 | console.log(data, copy);
 | // Then you see the same thing twice.
 |
 | // JSON would have converted your Date object into a string
 | const badJson = JSON.stringify(data);
 | const badCopy = JSON.parse(badJson);
 | console.log(badCopy)
 | // Then you notice that it doesn't look like the ones above
 |
 | The Date, Map, and Set classes are built into Reviver. All other classes
 | must be added to a reviver instance using register().
 |
 | Best practice:
 |
 | When you create a reviver, immediately pass your custom data class(es) to
 | reviver.register(). Define a class-level method on your custom class called
 | registerReviver(reviver). Within registerReviver(), call the reviver.add()
 | method and pass any other classes you'll need to reviver.register().
 |
 | Example:
 | // app.js
 | const reviver = new Reviver();
 | reviver.register(Mouse);
 |
 | // Mouse.js
 | Mouse.registerReviver = function (reviver) {
 |     reviver.add(
 |         'Mouse',
 |         Mouse,
 |         plain => new Mouse(plain),
 |         mouse => ({...mouse})
 |     );
 |     reviver.register(Cheese);
 | };
 |
 | This keeps your code clean, and it allows the custom class to call
 | reviver.register() for any classes that it deems important.
 |
 | In the above example, if the Mouse holds a Cheese object, it can now trust
 | that the reviver will know how to serialize and revive it. The Mouse won't
 | have to do anything extra to ensure the cheese comes back intact. And if you
 | know anything about mice, you know they appreciate peace of mind, pieces of
 | cheese, and puns. üßÄ üêÅ
 |
 | Good to know:
 |
 | The two callbacks to add() are a reviver and a replacer. The reviver accepts
 | a plain object and should return an object of the given class. The replacer
 | accepts an object of the given class and should return a plain object.
 |
 | When the reviver runs, any objects contained inside the plain object have
 | already been through their revival process. IE, it's plain objects all the
 | way down.
 |
 | When the replacer runs, no objects contained inside the class instance have
 | been through their replacement processes. IE, it's original objects all the
 | way down.
 |
 | Caveats:
 |
 | If the same object is present in two places in an object tree, it will be
 | written as two objects in JSON and will be revived as two objects.
 |
 | For this reason, and because of how JSON works, it's important not to use
 | circular references. If you need circular references, you can work around
 | the restriction by nulling out the circular part in the data returned from
 | your replacer callback and fixing them again during your reviver callback.
 |
 | At this time, the JSON uses '__class__' and '__data__' as special key
 | strings, so you should not use those in your data. In the future, we expect
 | to add a protection mechanism so you can use those keys.
 |
 | Some built-in types cannot be revived. These are usally for good reasons: a
 | Promise or a Function hold code and cannot be expected to perform later.
 | JSON can't do that. Symbols cannot retain the uniqueness feature they are
 | intended for, so they become null (in a very near future version).
 |
 | Reviver's behavior with some of these data types is different from the
 | behavior you would expect if you're familiar with the JSON object.
 |
 | What follows is an exhaustive list of the ways the Reviver treats data. Any
 | built-in type not represented below has undefined behavior that may change
 | in the future.
